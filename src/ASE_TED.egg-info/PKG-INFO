# ASE-TED: Topological Enhenced Dynamics

## Project Overview

**ASE-Topological Enhenced Dynamics** (i.e. TED) is an atomic simulation project built on the **Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)**. Its core goal is to address the problems of insufficient sampling for slow reaction processes and limited accuracy in reaction free energy calculations, typically in liquid-phase systems.

The project implements **precise topological reactivity control** (i.e. only a portion of topological changes are allowed) and **hybrid force field modelling** (i.e. QM:MM1:MM2 hybrid). It addresses the two long-standing bottlenecks in liquid-phase modelling: tremendously long sampling times for slow reaction processes (i.e. costly computational resources) and limited accuracy in reaction free energy calculations. Instead of running prohibitively long brute-force trajectories, TED lets you label only the atoms, bonds, functional groups or a port of react types that are allowed to react; everything else is protected in a classical, non-reactive restraint. In details, TED involves the following two kinds of potentials:

* Reactive potentials (ReaxFF, ANI, MACE, NequIP, etc.) to the small, chemically active region, and  
* Inexpensive classical force fields restraint (OPLS-AA, GAFF, AMBER) to the bulk solvent or spectator fragments.

Also, ASE-TED accelerates reaction processes through topology exchange enhancement strategies, where switch between reactive topologies follows the **thermodynamic consistency** of the system. Therefore, the free energy changes during the reactive process can be efficiently token into consideration by combining the **Free Energy Perturbation (FEP)** and **Non Equilibrium Processes** method.

The project integrates multiple high-performance dynamics engines—PuReMD, LAMMPS, and OpenMM—to strike an optimal balance between simulation fidelity and computational cost. It is useful for researchers to investigate sluggish kinetic phenomena in solution-phase organic reactions, with particular strength in capturing the intricate evolution of polymer networks.

## Features

1. **Fine-grained Topological Reactivity Control**
   - Specify reactive/non-reactive topological units, supporting reactivity screening at the atom/bond/functional group level.
2. **Seamless Hybrid Force Field Coupling**
   - Reactive topologies: Adopt ReaxFF or MLFFs to describe specific bond breaking and formation. Can dynamically switch between reactive topologies.
   - Non-reactive topologies: Use OPLSAA, GAFF, and other classical force fields for bond parameterization to ensure computational efficiency and stability.
3. **Topology Exchange Enhancement Strategy**
   - Smart interaction between reactive topologies to avoid local minima trapping, to fast explore the reactive space.
   - Soft restraint to avoid structure degeneration during the reactive process.
4. **Free Energy Calculation with Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) and Non Equilibrium Processes (NEP)**
   - Integrate the Free Energy Perturbation method to accurately calculate the free energy barrier and thermodynamic parameters of liquid-phase reactions by perturbing the system between different topological states.

## Notes

## Future Plans
